Domain 1 - Security+ Cleaned Questions with Answers

Felicia wants to deploy an encryption solution that will protect files in motion as they are copied between file shares as well as at rest, and also needs it to support granular, per-user security. What type of solution should she select?
A. Partition encryption
B. File encryption
C. Full-disk encryption
D. Record-level encryption
Answer: B.

Explanation: File encryption meets all of the needs described. Full-disk encryption is easier to deploy and manage but does not protect individual files in motion and does not effectively support multiuser scenarios. Partition-level encryption has the same challenges, albeit at a partition rather than full-disk level. Record-level encryption is typically used in databases to protect individual records or entries.

Valerie wants to use a certificate to handle multiple subdomains for her website, including the sales.example.com and support.example.com subdomains. What type of certificate should she use?
A. A self-signed certificate
B. A root of trust certificate
C. A CRL certificate
D. A wildcard certificate
Answer: D.

Explanation: Wildcard certificates are used to handle multiple subdomains with a single certificate. A self-signed certificate will not be recognized by browsers and other services, creating confusion for customers. Root of trust certificates and CRL certificates are not types of certificates.

What information is analyzed during a gap analysis?
A. Control objectives and controls intended to meet the objectives
B. Physically separate networks and their potential connection points
C. Compensating controls and the controls they are replacing
D. Security procedures and the policies they are designed to support

Explanation: Gap analysis considers control objectives and the controls that are intended to meet the objectives. Physically separate networks, compensating controls, and security procedures may be reviewed, but the primary focus is on control objectives and their corresponding controls.

Susanâ€™s team has recommended an application restart for a production, customer-facing application as part of an urgent patch due to a security update. What technical implication is the most common concern when conducting an application restart?
A. Application configuration changes caused by the restart
B. Whether the patch will properly apply
C. Lack of security controls during the restart
D. The downtime during the restart
Answer: D.

Explanation: In most production environments downtime is the primary concern when considering an application restart. Many application architectures are designed to allow restarts of individual systems or services without creating an outage or downtime. Configuration changes should not be created by a restart, patches generally apply properly, and security controls should be in place throughout the process.

Using a tool like git is most frequently associated with what critical change management process?
A. Having a backout plan
B. Stakeholder analysis
C. Version control
D. Standard operating procedures (SOPs)
Answer: C.

Explanation: Organizations frequently use tools like git to build repositories that support their need for version control. Backout plans might note that you need to return to the prior version but will need to include how to do so. Stakeholder analysis and SOPs are not specifically supported by or improved by using git.

Jacob is concerned that the password used for one of his organizationâ€™s services is weak, and he wants to make it harder to crack by making it harder to test possible keys during a brute-force attack. What is this technique called?
A. Master keying
B. Key stretching
C. Key rotation
D. Passphrase armoring
Answer: B.

Explanation: Key stretching makes potentially weak keys more resistant to brute-forcing and often involves using a hash or block cipher repeatedly to make the original value harder to crack. Key rotation is the process of changing keys on a periodic basis to limit the impact of potential exposure. Master keying and passphrase armoring are not commonly used concepts for information security, although master keys are used for physical locks.

Log monitoring is an example of what control category?
A. Managerial
B. Operational
C. Physical
D. Technical

Explanation: Operational controls like log monitoring, change management processes, and vulnerability management are all put in place to support managing and using technology in a secure manner. Managerial controls focus on policies, physical controls involve tangible measures, and technical controls involve specific technologies.

Rick wants to make offline brute-force attacks against his password file very difficult for attackers. Which of the following is not a common technique to make passwords harder to crack?
A. Use of a salt
B. Use of a pepper
C. Use of a purpose-built password hashing algorithm
D. Encrypting password plain text using symmetric encryption
Answer: D.

Explanation: Retaining the actual password is not a best practice, and thus encrypting password plain text is not a common technique to make passwords harder to crack. Since the application would need the cryptographic key to read the passwords, anybody who had access to that key could decrypt the passwords. Using a salt, a pepper, and a cryptographic hashing algorithm designed for passwords are all common best practices to prevent offline brute-force attacks.

### 9. Diffie-Hellman and RSA are both examples of what important encryption-related solution?

Explanation: Key escrow supports compliance, administrative access, and emergencies but doesnâ€™t prevent key rotation, which is still required post-departure.

### 136. Yariv discovers that he has exposed his private key to other users in his organization by sending it via email instead of his public key. What should he do?
A. Ask the other users to delete any copies of his private key that they may have
B. Immediately add his key to a CRL and reissue the key
C. Create a new keypair and notify others that he has replaced his keypair
D. Continue to operate as normal as long as the private key was not used maliciously
Answer: C. Create a new keypair and notify others that he has replaced his keypair
Explanation: A compromised private key requires a new keypair and notification to ensure secure communication. Deleting copies is unreliable, CRLs are for certificates, and continuing is insecure.

### 137. What happens if a mistake is made and an incorrect transaction is entered into the open public ledger in a blockchain?
A. The transaction is reversed once it is discovered, and the original transaction is removed from the record
B. A new transaction must be processed, and both transactions remain in the record
C. The original transaction is updated and becomes the new record
D. An error lock must be mined and labeled with the transaction number and error details
Answer: B. A new transaction must be processed, and both transactions remain in the record
Explanation: Blockchains are immutable; errors require a new transaction, and both remain in the ledger. Reversals, updates, or error locks are not standard blockchain processes.

### 138. Which of the following activities will not typically result in a need to update policies and procedures?
A. Deploying a new application
B. Installing patches for an existing application
C. Conducting a lessons learned exercise after an incident
D. Changes in regulations
Answer: B. Installing patches for an existing application
Explanation: Patching rarely changes policies/procedures. New applications, incident lessons, and regulatory changes often require updates.

### 139. Hrantâ€™s organization wants to ensure that staff members use both something they know and something they have as part of their physical access control scheme. Which of the following solutions meets that requirement?
A. Security guards and access badges
B. Keys and access control vestibules
C. Access badges and PINs
D. Security guards and access control vestibules
Answer: C. Access badges and PINs
Explanation: Badges (something you have) and PINs (something you know) provide two-factor authentication. Guards and vestibules donâ€™t inherently meet both criteria.

### 140. Julia wants to detect if an intruder enters a space using a sensor system. Which of the following is not typically used to detect intruders?
A. Infrared sensors
B. Ultrasonic sensors
C. Microwave sensors
D. Pressure sensors
Answer: D. Pressure sensors
Explanation: Infrared, ultrasonic, and microwave sensors detect intruders via motion or presence. Pressure sensors are used for specific applications like footsteps, not general intruder detection.

### 141. Which of the following is not true for a secure cryptographic hash system?
A. Hashes are a one-way function
B. Hashes generate a fixed length output
C. Hashes may generate the same output for multiple inputs
D. Hashes are commonly used to verify the integrity of files
Answer: C. Hashes may generate the same output for multiple inputs
Explanation: Secure hashes (e.g., SHA-256) are designed to avoid collisions (same output for different inputs). They are one-way, fixed-length, and used for integrity verification.

### 142. Casey wants to prevent tailgating attacks on her datacenter. What type of physical security solution should she put in place?
A. Video surveillance
B. Bollards
C. An access control vestibule
D. Access badges
Answer: C. An access control vestibule
Explanation: Access control vestibules prevent tailgating by requiring sequential door authentication. Surveillance detects, bollards stop vehicles, and badges donâ€™t address tailgating.

### 143. As Casey continues to work to secure her datacenter, she decides to deploy access badges. What technique will provide the greatest assurance that a stolen or cloned access badge will not allow an attacker access?
A. Use barcode-based badges
B. Require a PIN along with the badge
C. Use RFID-based badges
D. Include a picture of the user on the badge
Answer: B. Require a PIN along with the badge
Explanation: A PIN (something you know) with a badge (something you have) adds two-factor authentication, preventing stolen badge misuse. Barcodes/RFID donâ€™t add security, and pictures rely on human verification.

### 144. What term describes the function of digital signatures related to proving that the signature was provided by the owner of a given private key?
A. Ledger-based validation
B. Nonrepudiation
C. Key stretching
D. Authentication
Answer: B. Nonrepudiation
Explanation: Digital signatures provide nonrepudiation, proving the signerâ€™s identity via their private key. Ledger-based validation, key stretching, and authentication are unrelated or incorrect.

### 145. John wants to send his public key to another user. What steps are necessary to do so?
A. The key must be sent using Diffie-Hellman
B. The key can simply be sent via email or other means
C. The key must be sent using RSA
D. The key must be signed, then sent via email or other means
Answer: B. The key can simply be sent via email or other means
Explanation: Public keys are safe to share openly (e.g., via email). Diffie-Hellman and RSA are for key exchange, and signing is unnecessary for public keys.

### 146. Tracy wants to use the most secure salting solution she can. Which of the following options will provide the most secure salt?
A. Set a salt value and store it in the program code
B. Generate a unique salt for each hashed entry
C. Generate a unique salt value every time a value is used
D. Use a fixed salt stored in a database
Answer: B. Generate a unique salt for each hashed entry
Explanation: Unique salts per hash maximize security by preventing rainbow table attacks. Fixed salts or repeated salts reduce effectiveness, and per-use salts are impractical.

### 147. Bob conducts a periodic risk assessment of his organization. What category of security control is this?
A. Technical
B. Managerial
C. Operational
D. Physical
Answer: B. Managerial
Explanation: Risk assessments are managerial controls, focusing on risk management processes. Technical controls are technology-based, operational controls manage tech securely, and physical controls are tangible.

### 148. After a breach, Jackie removes malicious software from a server that she is responsible for. What control type should she classify this as?
A. Preventive
B. Corrective
C. Compensating
D. Deterrent
Answer: B. Corrective
Explanation: Removing malware corrects a security issue, making it a corrective control. Preventive controls stop issues, compensating controls address exceptions, and deterrents discourage attacks.

### 149. What can a root SSL (TLS) certificate do?
A. Remove a certificate from a CRL
B. Generate a signing key and use it to sign a new certificate
C. Authorize new CA users
D. Allow key stretching
Answer: B. Generate a signing key and use it to sign a new certificate
Explanation: Root certificates sign subordinate certificates, establishing trust. They donâ€™t manage CRLs, authorize users, or perform key stretching.

### 150. Christina wants to authenticate individuals as part of her AAA implementation. What will she need to do to authenticate users?
A. Match users to roles and ensure that rights are assigned
B. Conduct biometric enrollments for every user
C. Use identity proofing for each user she creates
D. Ensure that users provide an identity and one or more authentication factors
Answer: D. Ensure that users provide an identity and one or more authentication factors
Explanation: Authentication requires users to claim an identity and provide factors (e.g., password, biometrics). Role matching is authorization, biometric enrollment is optional, and identity proofing is for onboarding.
