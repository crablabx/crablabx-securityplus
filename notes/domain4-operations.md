# 🛠️ Domain 4: Security Operations

This document covers operational security procedures, monitoring, response, and incident management for Domain 4 of the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) exam.

---

## 🧩 4.1 Monitoring & Detection

### 🔍 Logging & Monitoring
- **SIEM** – Security Information & Event Management
- **Syslog** – Standard for forwarding logs
- **Log Aggregation** – Central collection for analysis
- **SOAR** – Security Orchestration, Automation & Response

### 📊 Detection Methods
- **Signature-Based** – Looks for known threats (AV, IDS)
- **Heuristic/Behavior-Based** – Looks for abnormal behavior
- **Anomaly-Based** – Compares activity to a baseline
- **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)** – Advanced endpoint monitoring

---

## 🛡️ 4.2 Incident Response

### 🚨 IR Process Steps
1. **Preparation**
2. **Identification**
3. **Containment**
4. **Eradication**
5. **Recovery**
6. **Lessons Learned**

### 📄 Playbooks & Runbooks
- **Playbook** – Predefined response plan for specific threats
- **Runbook** – Step-by-step technical tasks

## 🧪 4.3 Digital Forensics

| Phase | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Identification** | Determine if an incident occurred |
| **Preservation** | Prevent alteration of evidence |
| **Collection** | Acquire data/images legally and safely |
| **Examination** | Analyze evidence |
| **Analysis & Reporting** | Make findings and present them |

### 🔐 Chain of Custody
- Tracks who handled evidence and when
- Must be documented end-to-end

## 🛜 4.4 Network & Host Security

- **Firewall Types** – Packet filtering, stateful, proxy-based, WAF
- **IDS/IPS** – Detect/prevent network threats
- **DLP** – Prevent data exfiltration
- **Patch Management** – Regular updates to fix vulnerabilities
- **Hardening** – Removing unnecessary services/software

---

## 📌 Study Tips
- Memorize the IR steps in order
- Understand log sources and how SIEM works
- Know key forensic concepts and legal considerations
