# ⚠️ Domain 2: Threats, Vulnerabilities & Mitigations

This document covers the core threats, attack types, and mitigation strategies featured in Domain 2 of the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) exam.

## 🛑 2.1 Common Threat Types

### 🧑‍💻 Social Engineering
- **Phishing** – Tricking users via fake emails or websites
- **Spear Phishing** – Targeted phishing
- **Vishing** – Voice-based phishing
- **Smishing** – SMS-based phishing
- **Impersonation** – Pretending to be someone else (CEO fraud, helpdesk)

### 📦 Malware
- **Virus** – Attaches to files and spreads
- **Worm** – Self-replicating across networks
- **Trojan** – Disguised as legitimate software
- **Ransomware** – Encrypts files and demands payment
- **Spyware** – Gathers data without consent

### 🧨 Other Threats
- **DoS/DDoS** – Denial of service
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** – Intercepts communication
- **Credential Stuffing** – Using leaked passwords on other accounts
- **Zero-Day** – Exploits a newly discovered vulnerability

## 🧰 2.2 Vulnerabilities

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Unpatched Systems** | Missing updates or security fixes |
| **Default Credentials** | Using factory-set usernames/passwords |
| **Misconfigurations** | Open ports, overly permissive access |
| **Improper Input Validation** | Opens the door to injection attacks |

## 🔐 2.3 Mitigation Techniques

- **Security Patches** – Apply updates regularly
- **User Awareness Training** – Combat phishing & SE
- **Firewall Rules** – Block known bad traffic
- **Access Controls** – Least privilege model
- **Network Segmentation** – Limit attack scope
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – Defends against credential theft
- **Endpoint Protection** – AV/EDR for malware detection

---

## 📌 Study Tips
- Be able to recognize threat types by scenario
- Understand basic malware behavior
- Know how to apply mitigation techniques in layered defense
