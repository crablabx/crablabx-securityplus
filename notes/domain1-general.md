## 🔐 1.1 Key Security Concepts

### ✅ CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality** – Keeping data secret (e.g., encryption, access control)
- **Integrity** – Ensuring data isn’t altered (e.g., hashing, checksums)
- **Availability** – Ensuring data/systems are accessible (e.g., backups, redundancy)

### 🔒 Security Controls
- **Administrative** – Policies, training, procedures
- **Technical** – Firewalls, antivirus, encryption
- **Physical** – Locks, guards, cameras

## 🧠 1.2 Threat Actors & Intelligence Sources

### 👤 Threat Actors
- **Script Kiddies** – Use tools without full understanding
- **Hacktivists** – Politically/socially motivated
- **Insider Threats** – Employees or contractors
- **Nation-State Actors** – Government-sponsored APTs

### 🔎 Intelligence Sources
- **OSINT** – Public info (e.g., WHOIS, social media)
